# Portfolio and CV website
My portfolio website. Will be live at [arnoldson.online](https://arnoldson.online)

This site was started after my first course in webdevelopment at Lernia.

##About the site
This site is probably a bit more complicated then necessary. I started the site only 3 months into my javascript developer education. I have specifically refrained from using some finished functions and tools. I didn't use a multilingual CMS, Bootstrap or any pre-made ajax contact form or mailer backend. jQuery is however included for convinence, especially for handling ajax requests.

##Dependencies used
* jQuery 3.1.1
* Normalize 5.0.0
* Font Awesome 4.7.0
* Foundation Icons 3
* flag-icon-css

##Other tool
* Atom
* Livereload
